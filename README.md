I'm an aspiring **full-stack Junior Developer** graduating from Makers Academy looking to further hone my skills in software development. With a technical academic background and an unconventional job history, it's led me to the world of coding — a craft which I find myself more excited with as time elapses, whether it's building useful apps, experimenting with new languages, solving problems or adding another tool to my programming arsenal!

# Background

Graduating from university in 2012, the following years led me in various paths — from the freedom granted to travel the world through online poker to an office environment with a wide spectrum of responsibilities. At my last place of employment, I began figuring out how to automate monotonous tasks to make my coworkers and my own life easier. An enjoyable experience, that was the catalyst into taking that skill-set further — thus beginning my journey in programming.

Coming out of Makers Academy, I'm looking for a position in a company which shares my enthusiasm for pushing one's software craftsmanship, maintaining best coding practices and encouraging the desire to continue learning throughout. I would like to work for a forward thinking company that puts values and invests in their new developers, gradually shaping them to be assets for the projects they work on and developing tools that aid not only themselves but others that can use them, too.

# Projects
| Title | Description | Development Timeframe | Technologies Used | Test Suites/CIs/CDs Employed |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| [PinkFish (Facebook)](https://github.com/Hemesh-Unka/acebook-pinkFish) | Five rag tag individuals band together and set off to create our interpretation of Facebook with an emphasis on focusing on learning as a group, its design driven by a plush toy of a pink fish found close to our desk. | 2 weeks | Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript, JQuery, PostgreSQL,  Heroku, AWS S3 Bucket | RSpec, Capybara, Travis, CodeClimate, Selenium-Webdriver (using headless Chrome) |
| [Tasteless Notes](https://github.com/vivianallen/tastelessnotes) | A group of four christened 'The Tasteless Sheep' create a notes SPA - the caveat being we weren't allowed to use any frameworks. If we wanted to employ TDD, we had to build the test framework ourselves.  | 1 week |HTML/CSS, JavaScript | Tasteless Testing Suite  |

# Skills

### Clean code advocate

Makers Academy shaped and facilitated my want to be a purveyor of clean code — exercising principles such as SOLID and DRY, practicing usage of XP Values in group situations to ensure we were on the same wavelength, striking a fine balance between having an efficient and a readable codebase (for yourself as well as for others!) and using TDD/BDD to keep pesky bugs out of the way when that crafted code is pushed to production. 

I truly believe in this approach to programming and coding and hope to work with others that respect it as much as I do.

### Adaptability / Hunger to learn

From diving deep into an environment with a myriad of unfamiliarities, an unconventional profession where stagnation of one's progression of their skills can easily spell the end of your career or an office where my range of responsibilities frequently fluctuates, I find the initial discomfort energising and drives me to rise to the occasion. 

This love for venturing into the unknown has resulted in various experiences I've gained such as basic Mandarin proficiency in a short space of time, positive results for my tenure as a poker player, improving my soft skills as well as my technical side — and now taking those lessons with me and pushing the envelop when it comes to reaching my potential as a programmer solving problems.

### Teamwork / Mediation

A true believer of the mantra that a productive team is one that can maintain the ability to work through the highs and the lows, I'm proactive with feedback and always attempt to dispel any friction between team members I work with through my empathetic ability and holding civil discussion — hopefully bearing fruit by compromising at the very least; ideally an agreeable solution altogether. 

My experience at Goldwind, Camseng and now Makers Academy — all places which have such a broad spectrum of personalities — has aided immensely in sharpening up my soft skills. As a generally amicable person, I have a strong ability to facilitate and mend misunderstandings or give a team member a shoulder to lean on if there are personal issues outside of a professional environment that is disrupting them.

### Attention to detail

Frequently, the devil is in the details no matter what you do and in software development, it's no different. Working in IT support, much like programming, when you're problem solving, it's important to ensure you have it broken down so that you ask the _right_ question in the quest for the _right_ solution.

Sometimes, it's the even _smaller_ details like missing a semi-colon or a return keyword where it's not necessarily implicit. Through a workflow and debugging process I hold myself accountable to, I have a strong ability at taking a look at codebases whether it's my own or others I've never seen before, spotting issues that're preventing progressing and working to move on from them, continuing the problem solving adventure.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (Feb 2018 - May 2018)

- A neverending curiousity for coding and new technologies
- Learning, honing and maintaining best practices for coding (e.g. TDD, XP Values, Agile approach)
- Always aiming to sharpen my toolset, crafting well-written, readable code

#### University of Ulster, Jordanstown (2008 - 2012)

- BSc. (Hons) Computer Science — 2:1 obtained
- Placement year was done abroad with no previous knowledge of Mandarin Chinese, having to quickly learn the fundamentals to improve communication with my colleagues and quality of life for myself

#### University of Ulster, Jordanstown (2007 - 2008)

- Foundation Year - Diploma in Industrial Studies — passed with Merit

## Interests

* Exercise - A strong belief that a healthy body is directly related to a healthy mind, I train frequently to keep myself in shape. Mostly partial to weightlifting/powerlifting but I enjoy a wide variety of exercise such as running, parkour and yoga as well.
* Travelling/Exploring - An urban heart by nature, I love travelling to countries and cities I've never been before, getting lost in the streets and absorbing its culture in the midst of it all.
* Learning languages - With learning Mandarin on my placement year, I found I enjoy the process of learning new languages and strive to continue doing so when times allowed.
* Playing fighting games on a competitive level (Street Fighter, Tekken) - A more niche hobby, it has introduced more than just a craving to sate my competitive desire in video games: new friends with a common interest and travelling around the world to not only compete but experience new cultures which I might not have otherwise.
