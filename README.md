I'm an aspiring **full-stack Junior Developer** graduating from Makers Academy looking to further hone my skills in software development. With a technical academic background and an unconventional job history, it's led me to the world of coding — a craft which I find myself more excited with as time elapses, whether it's building useful apps, experimenting with new languages, solving problems or adding another tool to my programming arsenal!

# Background

Graduating from university in 2012, the following years led me in various paths — from the freedom granted to travel the world through online poker to an office environment with a wide spectrum of responsibilities. At my last place of employment, I began figuring out how to automate monotonous tasks to make my coworkers and my own life easier. An enjoyable experience, that was the catalyst into taking that skill-set further — thus beginning my journey in programming.

Coming out of Makers Academy, I'm looking for a position in a company which shares my enthusiasm for pushing one's software craftsmanship, maintaining best coding practices and encouraging the desire to continue learning throughout. I would like to work for a forward thinking company that invests in their new developers, gradually shaping them to be assets for the projects they work on and developing tools that aid not only themselves but others that can use them, too.

# Projects
| Title | Description | Development Timeframe | Technologies Used | Test Suites/CIs/CDs Employed |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| [PinkFish (Facebook)](https://github.com/Hemesh-Unka/acebook-pinkFish) | Five rag tag individuals band together and set off to create our interpretation of Facebook with an emphasis on focusing on learning as a group. The site's design was driven by a plush toy of a pink fish found close to our desk. | 2 weeks | Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript, JQuery, PostgreSQL,  Heroku, AWS S3 Bucket | RSpec, Capybara, Travis, CodeClimate, Selenium-Webdriver (using headless Chrome) |
| [Tasteless Notes](https://github.com/vivianallen/tastelessnotes) | A group of four christened 'The Tasteless Sheep' create a notes SPA - the caveat being we weren't allowed to use any frameworks. If we wanted to employ TDD, we had to build the test framework ourselves.  | 1 week |HTML/CSS, JavaScript | Tasteless Testing Suite  |

# Skills

### Clean code advocate

Makers Academy shaped and facilitated my want to be a purveyor of clean code. Exercising programming principles such as SOLID and DRY, practicing usage of XP Values in group situations to ensure we were on the same wavelength, striking a fine balance between having an efficient and a readable codebase (for yourself as well as for others!) and using TDD/BDD to keep pesky bugs out of the way when that crafted code is pushed to production. 

I truly believe in this approach to programming and coding and hope to work with others that respect it as much as I do.

### Adaptability

I consider myself a highly adaptive individual able to adjust based on the situation.

- Once I arrived to start my placement year in China with Goldwind, I found out during my onboarding process that I wasn't suited for the role they needed. Already settled and not keen on returning home empty handed, I asked my superior if there was a purpose I _could_ fill in the department. Noticing a communication issue with a different member of staff and an international intern, I inquired if it would be appropriate for me to take care of the English speaking staff and escalate if necessary. It turned out to be a fruitful endeavour, creating a role for myself where I could use the skills I had and providing relief for an understaffed IT team.

### Teamwork / Mediation

A true believer of the mantra that a productive team is one that can maintain the ability to work through the highs and the lows, I'm proactive with feedback and always attempt to dispel any friction between team members I work with through my empathetic ability and holding civil discussion — hopefully bearing fruit by compromising at the very least; ideally an agreeable solution altogether. 

My experience at Goldwind, Camseng and now Makers Academy — all places which have such a broad spectrum of personalities — has aided immensely in sharpening up my soft skills. As a generally amicable person, I have a strong ability to facilitate and mend misunderstandings or give a team member a shoulder to lean on if there are personal issues outside of a professional environment that is disrupting them.

### Attention to detail

During my group project 'Tasteless Notes', progress was smooth but there would be brief periods where we would be collectively stumped. Taking a step back, I applied the rigorous debugging process I exercised on my own code to our group's.

One particular instance was when we were building our testing framework. We couldn't figure out why it was showing `undefined` instead of the pass/fail statements we'd built. Combing carefully through the code, I realised we were missing the `return` keyword - something implicitly implied in Ruby but not in JavaScript.

Once added at the appropriate lines in our codebase, we tested and ran it once more. A collective jovial cheer erupted from our group as we achieved the desired result - outputs of our tests properly passing and failing with no `undefined` properties.

# Education

#### Makers Academy (Feb 2018 - May 2018)

- A neverending curiousity for coding and new technologies
- Learning, honing and maintaining best practices for coding (e.g. TDD, XP Values, Agile approach)
- Always aiming to sharpen my toolset, crafting well-written, readable code

#### University of Ulster, Jordanstown (2008 - 2012)

- BSc. (Hons) Computer Science — 2:1 obtained
- Placement year was done abroad with no previous knowledge of Mandarin Chinese, having to quickly learn the fundamentals to improve communication with my colleagues and quality of life for myself

#### University of Ulster, Jordanstown (2007 - 2008)

- Foundation Year - Diploma in Industrial Studies — passed with Merit

# Status

A Northern Irish born citizen, I possess both a **United Kingdom** and **Irish** passport.

# Interests

* Exercise - A strong belief that a healthy body is directly related to a healthy mind, I train frequently to keep myself in shape. Mostly partial to weightlifting/powerlifting but I enjoy a wide variety of exercise such as running, parkour and yoga as well.
* Travelling/Exploring - An urban heart by nature, I love travelling to countries and cities I've never been before, getting lost in the streets and absorbing its culture in the midst of it all.
* Learning languages - With learning Mandarin on my placement year, I found I enjoy the process of learning new languages and strive to continue doing so when times allowed.
* Playing fighting games on a competitive level (Street Fighter, Tekken) - A more niche hobby, it has introduced more than just a craving to sate my competitive desire in video games: new friends with a common interest and travelling around the world to not only compete but experience new cultures which I might not have otherwise.
