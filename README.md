I'm an aspiring **full-stack Junior Developer** graduating from Makers Academy looking to further hone my skills in software development. With a technical academic background and an unconventional job history, it's led me to the world of coding — a craftsmanship which I find myself more excited with as time elapses, whether it's building cool apps, solving problems or adding another tool to my arsenal!

# Background

Graduating from university in 2012, the following years led me in various paths — from the freedom granted to travel the world through online poker to an unsuccessful foray into professional video gaming. At my last place of work, I began figuring out how to automate monotonous tasks to make my coworkers and my own life easier. An enjoyable problem solving experience, that was the catalyst into taking that skill-set further — thus beginning my journey in programming.

## Projects
|Title | Description | Development Timeframe | Technologies Used | Test Suites/CIs/CDs Employed |
|--|--|--|--|--|
| [PinkFish (Facebook)](https://github.com/Hemesh-Unka/acebook-pinkFish) | In a group of five, we set off to create our interpretation of Facebook with an emphasis on focusing on learning as a group, its design driven by a plush toy of a pink fish found close to our desk. | 2 weeks | Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript, JQuery, PostgreSQL,  Heroku, AWS S3 Bucket | RSpec, Capybara, Travis, CodeClimate, Selenium-Webdriver (using headless Chrome) |
| [Tasteless Notes](https://github.com/vivianallen/tastelessnotes) | A group of four christened 'The Tasteless Sheep' create a notes SPA - the caveat being we weren't allowed to use any frameworks. If we wanted to employ TDD, we had to build the test framework ourselves.  | 1 week | JavaScript | Tasteless Testing Suite  |

## Skills

#### Adaptability

For my placement year, upon speaking with my immediate supervisor on arrival, there appeared to me a miscommunication between recruitment and the IT department as I discovered they had a completely different role in mind for me than what was advertised.

Despite the initial predicament I found myself in, I managed to discover and support a different problem that required attention - a lack of immediate support for the international staff operating within the company as only my boss and a few other members of staff had a basic command of English for an already understaffed department.

We agreed that I would take care or follow up on any issues for my international peers, relieving the department of a lot of pressure which could be allocated to other areas as well as a happier workforce, comfortable in the knowledge that there was someone could handle their software, hardware and other computer-related issues swiftly without a language barrier.

#### Teamwork / Mediation

With the fast paced nature of working in the food supply industry, tensions had the tendency to get out of hand at Camseng due to various reasons such as stock shortages which were miscommunicated between members of staff. As someone who was amicable among all of my peers and had no communication problems with anyone within the company, I frequently acted as the mediator, ensuring that they would both see each other's point of view and to make an attempt to come up with a solution to fix the task at hand as well as to help make amends among them. Often, these issues could be easily resolved but just needed a clear head from both parties to come to a solution that will work for everyone.

I always try to ensure my peers' happiness and keep morale high as I genuinely believe that coworkers that get along better also work together better.

#### Quick-learner

During my time at Goldwind, the company was looking to expand on a global level and needed an international website for prospective investors. As part of a group assigned to this project, we sought bespoke web development teams to listen to their sales pitch and inquire about the services they provided to us. Unable to come to an agreement between various teams on the budget, my fellow IT placement student and I looked at the specifications needed for the website and we thought that it was something we could deploy ourselves.

Doing our due diligence, we researched various CMS's as we needed a system that would allow less tech-savvy members to update the website once our placement periods expire. We decided upon using Drupal, a system that neither of us had used before. Ultimately, we were able to give Goldwind an international presence on the internet that satisfied the budget given to us.

#### Working under pressure

I thrive under the throes of pressure, keeping a cool head and managing to maintain a high level of standard even under the clock. During my time at Camseng, I was initially brought on as on-site IT support to maintain and fix any immediate issues that didn't require calling the off-site support as well as some extra miscellaneous tasks such as creating flyers for sales promotions.

I soon found my responsibilities rapidly expanding as staff turnover took its toll, needing to preform extra tasks such as bookkeeping to ensure there was no ambiguity with payments on top of maintaining my already existing responsibilities - a time sensitive role as we needed to ensure that the payments were posted by a certain time in case customers requested invoices for previous orders.

These were all performed during a shift in where I was often the only person handling in-call inquiries, assisting our haulage staff with their deliveries, fulfilling customer orders, aiding customers in finding out any outstanding invoices or erroneous deliveries as well as passing through calls to appropriate departments. I feel that my strong sense of being able to prioritise what needs done and to ensure that everything gets seen through attributes to this skill.
